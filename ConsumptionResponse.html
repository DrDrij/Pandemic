  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">I </span> <a 
 id="x1-1000I"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 123--><p class="noindent" >In the decade since the Great Recession, macroeconomics has made great progress by insisting that
models be consistent with microeconomic evidence (see <a 
href="#XkmpHandbook">Krueger, Mitman, and Perri</a> (<a 
href="#XkmpHandbook">2016</a>) for a
survey). From the new generation of models, we <a 
href="https://econ.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/papers/cAndCwithSTickyE" >take one</a> speciﬁcally focused on reconciling apparent
conﬂicts between micro and macro evidence about consumption dynamics (<a 
href="#XhrsHabit">Havranek, Rusnak, and
Sokolova</a> (<a 
href="#XhrsHabit">2017</a>)) and adapt it to incorporate two aspects of the coronavirus crisis. First, because the
tidal wave of layoﬀs for employees of shuttered businesses will have a large impact on their income and
spending, assumptions must be made about the employment dynamics of laid oﬀ workers. Second,
even consumers who remain employed will have restricted spending options (nobody can eat dinner at
a shuttered restaurant).
<!--l. 125--><p class="indent" >  On the ﬁrst count, we model the likelihood that many of the people unemployed during the
lockdown will be able to quickly return to their old jobs (or similar ones) by assuming
that the typical job loser has a two-thirds chance of being reemployed in the same or a
similar job after each quarter of unemployment. However, we expect that some kinds of
jobs will not come back quickly after the lockdown,<sup class="textsuperscript"><a 
href="#enz.1"><span 
class="ec-lmr-10x-x-109">1</span></a></sup> and that people who worked in these
kinds of jobs will have more diﬃculty ﬁnding a new job. We call these people the ‘deeply
unemployed’ and assume that there is a one-third chance each quarter that they become
merely ‘normal unemployed.’ The ‘normal unemployed’ have a jobﬁnding rate that matches
average historical unemployment spell of 1.5 quarters (as a ‘normal unemployed’ person).
Thus a deeply unemployed person expects to remain in the ‘deep unemployment’ state
for three quarters on average, and then remain unemployed for another one and a half
quarters. When the pandemic hits, we assume that 10 percent of model households become
normal unemployed and an additional 5 percent become deeply unemployed; in line with
empirical evidence, the unemployment probabilities are skewed toward households who are
young, unskilled and have low income. (All of these assumptions can be adjusted using our
<a 
href="http://econ-ark.org/pandemicdashboard" >dashboard</a>; changing several parameters simultaneously requires installation of the <a 
href="https://github.com/econ-ark/Pandemic" >software
toolkit</a>).
<!--l. 127--><p class="indent" >  On the second count, we model the restricted spending options by assuming that during the
lockdown spending is less enjoyable (there is a negative shock to the ‘marginal utility of consumption.’)
Based on a tally of sectors that we judge to be substantially shuttered during the ‘lockdown,’ we
calibrate an <img 
src="ConsumptionResponse2x.svg" alt="11  " class="math";align="absmiddle"> percent reduction to spending. Thus households will prefer to defer some of
their consumption into the future, when it will yield them greater utility. (See <a 
href="#XSpanishSpending">Carvalho,
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
Garcia, Hansen, Ortiz, Rodrigo, Rodriguez, and Ruiz</a> (<a 
href="#XSpanishSpending">2020</a>) for Spanish data already
showing a strong eﬀect of this kind in recent weeks, and <a 
href="#Xdenmark_pandemics">Andersen, Hansen, Johannesen,
and Sheridan</a> (<a 
href="#Xdenmark_pandemics">2020</a>) for similar evidence from Denmark).<sup class="textsuperscript"><a 
href="#enz.2"><span 
class="ec-lmr-10x-x-109">2</span></a></sup> In our baseline scenario, we
assume that this condition is removed with probability one-half after each quarter, so on
average remains for two quarters. When the ‘lockdown’ ends, the buildup of savings by
households who did not lose their jobs but whose spending was suppressed should result in a
partial recovery in consumer spending, but in our baseline scenario (without the CARES
act), total consumer spending remains below its pre-crisis peak through the foreseeable
future.
<!--l. 132--><p class="indent" >  Our model captures the two primary features of the CARES Act that aim to bolster consumer
spending:
      <ol  class="enumerate1" >
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-1002x1">The boost to unemployment insurance beneﬁts, amounting to $7,800 if unemployment
      lasts for 13 weeks.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-1004x2">The direct stimulus payments to households, amounting to $1,200 per adult.</li></ol>
<!--l. 138--><p class="indent" >  We estimate that the combination of expanded unemployment insurance beneﬁts and
stimulus payments should be suﬃcient to allow a swift recovery in consumer spending to
its pre-crisis levels under our default description of the pandemic, in which the lockdown
ends after two quarters on average. Overall, unemployment beneﬁts account for about 30
percent of the total aggregate consumption response and stimulus payments explain the
remainder.
<!--l. 141--><p class="indent" >  Our analysis partitions households into three groups based on their employment state when the
pandemic strikes and the lockdown begins.
<!--l. 143--><p class="indent" >  First, households in our model who do not lose their jobs will initially build up their savings, both
because of the lockdown-induced suppression of spending and because most of these households will
receive a signiﬁcant stimulus check, much of which the model says will be saved. Even without
the lockdown, we estimate that only about 20 percent of the stimulus money would be
spent immediately upon receipt, consistent with evidence from prior stimulus packages
about spending on nondurable goods and services. Once the lockdown ends, the spending
of the always-employed households rebounds strongly thanks to their healthy household
ﬁnances.
<!--l. 147--><p class="indent" >  The second category of households are the ‘normal unemployed,’ job losers who perceive that it is
likely they will be able to resume their old job (or get a similar new job) when the lockdown is over.
Our model predicts that the CARES Act will be particularly eﬀective in stimulating their
consumption, given the perception that their income shock will be largely transitory. Our model
predicts that by the end of 2021, the spending of this group will recover to the level it would have
achieved in the absence of the pandemic (‘baseline’); without the CARES Act, this recovery would
take more than a year longer.
<!--l. 150--><p class="indent" >  Finally, for households in the deeply unemployed category, our model says that the marginal
propensity to consume (MPC) from the checks will be considerably smaller, because they know they
must stretch that money for longer. Even with the stimulus from the CARES Act, we predict that
consumption spending for these households will not fully recover until the middle of 2023. Even so, the
act makes a big diﬀerence to their spending, particularly in the ﬁrst six quarters after the crisis.
For both groups of unemployed households, the eﬀect of the stimulus checks is dwarfed
by the increased unemployment beneﬁts, which arrive earlier and are much larger (per
recipient).
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
<!--l. 155--><p class="indent" >  Perhaps surprisingly, we ﬁnd the eﬀectiveness of the combined stimulus checks and unemployment
beneﬁts package for aggregate consumption is not substantially diﬀerent from a package that
distributed the same quantity of money equally between households. The reason for this is
twofold: ﬁrst, the extra unemployment beneﬁts in the CARES Act are generous enough
that many of the ‘normally’ unemployed remain ﬁnancially sound and can aﬀord to save
a good portion of those beneﬁts; second, the deeply unemployed expect their income to
remain depressed for some time and therefore save more of the stimulus for the future. In
the model, the fact that they do <span 
class="ec-lmri-12">not </span>spend immediately is actually a reﬂection of how
desperately they anticipate these funds will be needed to make it through a long period of
uncertainty. While unemployment beneﬁts do not strongly stimulate current consumption
of the deeply unemployed, they do provide important disaster relief for those who may
not be able to return to work for several quarters (see <a 
href="#Xkrugman_corona">Krugman</a> (<a 
href="#Xkrugman_corona">2020</a>) for an informal
discussion).
<!--l. 159--><p class="indent" >  In addition to our primary scenario’s relatively short lockdown period, we also consider a worse
scenario in which the lockdown is expected to last for four quarters and the unemployment rate
increases to 20 percent. In this case, we ﬁnd that the return of spending toward its no-pandemic path
takes roughly three years. Moreover, the spending of deeply unemployed households will fall steeply
unless the temporary unemployment beneﬁts in the CARES Act are extended for the duration of the
lockdown.
<!--l. 162--><p class="indent" >  Our modeling assumptions — about who will become unemployed, how long it will take them to
return to employment, and the direct eﬀect of the lockdown on consumption utility — could prove
to be oﬀ, in either direction. Reasonable analysts may diﬀer on all of these points, and
prefer a diﬀerent calibration. To encourage such exploration, we have made available our
modeling and prediction software, with the goal of making it easy for fellow researchers to test
alternative assumptions. Instructions for installing and running our code can be found <a 
href="https://github.com/econ-ark/Pandemic#reproduction-instructions" >here</a>;
alternatively, you can explore adjustments to our parametrization with an interactive dashboard
<a 
href="http://econ-ark.org/pandemicdashboard" >here</a>.
<!--l. 166--><p class="indent" >  There is a potentially important reason our model may underpredict the bounceback in consumer
spending when the lockdown ends: ‘pent up demand.’ This term captures the fact that purchases of
‘durable’ goods can be easily postponed, but that when the reason for postponement abates some
portion of the missing demand is made up for. (We put ‘durable’ in quotes because <a 
href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w19386" >‘memorable’</a> goods
(<a 
href="#XhkpMemory">Hai, Krueger, and Postlewaite</a> (<a 
href="#XhkpMemory">2013</a>)) have eﬀectively the same characteristics.) For simplicity,
our model does not include durable goods, because modeling spending on durables is a
formidable challenge. But it is plausible that, when the lockdown ends, people may want to
spend <span 
class="ec-lmri-12">more </span>than usual on memorable or durable goods to make up for earlier missing
spending.

heterogeneity in the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) across diﬀerent types of household
(employed, unemployed; young, old; rich, poor). This is motivated by the fact that the act distributes
money unevenly across households, particularly targeting unemployed households. A model that does
not appropriately capture both the degree to which the stimulus money is targeted, and the
diﬀerentials in responses across diﬀerently targeted groups, is unlikely to produce believable answers
about the spending eﬀects of the stimulus.

  <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">B </span> <a 
 id="x1-5000B"></a>Adaptations to Capture the Pandemic</h4>
<!--l. 194--><p class="noindent" >To model the pandemic, we add two new features to the model.
<!--l. 196--><p class="indent" >  First, our new category of ‘deeply unemployed’ households was created to capture the likelihood
that the pandemic will have long-lasting eﬀects on some kinds of businesses and jobs (e.g., the cruise
industry), even if the CARES act manages to successfully cushion much of the ﬁnancial hit to total
household income.
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
<!--l. 198--><p class="indent" >  Each quarter, our ‘deeply unemployed’ households have a two-thirds chance of remaining deeply
unemployed, and a one-third chance of becoming ‘normal unemployed.’ The expected time to
employment for a ‘deeply unemployed’ household is four and a half quarters, much longer than
the historical average length of a typical unemployment spell. Reﬂecting recent literature
on the ‘scarring eﬀects’ of unemployment spells, permanent income of both ‘normal’ and
‘deeply’ households declines by 0.5 percent each quarter due to ‘skill rot’ (rather than
following the default age proﬁle that would have been followed if the consumer had remained
employed).
<!--l. 201--><p class="indent" >  Second, a temporary negative shock to the <a 
href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marginalutility.asp" >marginal utility of consumption</a> captures the idea that,
during the period of the pandemic, many forms of consumption are undesirable or even
impossible.<sup class="textsuperscript"><a 
href="#enz.6"><span 
class="ec-lmr-10x-x-109">6</span></a></sup>
<!--l. 203--><p class="indent" >  The pandemic is modeled as an unexpected (MIT) shock, sending many households into both
normal and deep unemployment, as well as activating the negative shock to marginal utility.
Households understand and respond in a forward-looking way to their new circumstances (according
to their beliefs about its duration), but their decisions prior to the pandemic did not account for any
probability that it would occur.

  <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a

<!--l. 206--><p class="noindent" >The calibration choices for the pandemic scenario are very much open for debate. Here we have tried

in points of view around those medians. Section <a

lockdown and a larger increase in unemployment.
<!--l. 209--><p class="indent" >  Unemployment forecasts for Q2 2020 range widely, from less than 10 percent to over 30 percent, but

rate in Q2 2020 of just over 15 percent, consisting of ﬁve percent ‘deeply unemployed’ and ten percent
‘normal unemployed’ households.
<!--l. 212--><p class="indent" >  We calibrate the likelihood of becoming unemployed to match empirical facts about the
relationship of unemployment to education level, permanent income and age, which is likely to
matter because the hardest hit sectors skew young and unskilled.<sup class="textsuperscript"><a

assumptions on unemployment along these dimensions. In each education category, the solid line

median permanent income at each age, while the dotted lines represent the probability of
unemployment type for a household at the 5th and 95th percentile of permanent income
at each age; Appendix <a

used.
<!--l. 217--><p class="indent" >  To calibrate the drop in marginal utility, we estimate that 10.9 percent of the goods that make up
the consumer price index become highly undesirable, or simply unavailable, during the pandemic: food
away from home, public transportation including airlines, and motor fuel. We therefore multiply utility
from consumption during the period of the epidemic by a factor of 0.891. Furthermore, we
choose a one-half probability of exiting the period of lower marginal utility each quarter,
accounting for the possibility of a ‘second wave’ if restrictions are lifted too early — see

(ii) the pandemic with no ﬁscal response; (iii) the pandemic with both the stimulus checks and
extended unemployment beneﬁts in the CARES Act. The pandemic reduces consumption by ten
percentage points in Q2 2020 relative to the baseline.
<!--l. 285--><p class="indent" >  Without the CARES Act, consumption remains depressed through to the second half of 2021, at
which point spending actually rises above the baseline, as a result of the buildup of liquid assets
during the pandemic by households that do not lose their income. We capture the limited spending
options during the lockdown period by a reduction in the utility of consumption, which
makes household save more than they otherwise would usual during the pandemic, with the
result that they build up liquid assets. When the lockdown ends, the pent up savings of
the always-employed become available to ﬁnance a resurgence in their spending, but the
depressed spending of the two groups of unemployed people keeps total spending below the
baseline until most of them are reemployed, at which point their spending (mostly) recovers

<!--l. 289--><p class="indent" >  Figure <a 
href="#x1-90014">4<!--tex4ht:ref: cons_response2 --></a> decomposes the eﬀect of the pandemic on aggregate consumption (with no ﬁscal policy
response), separating the drop in marginal utility from the reduction in income due to mass layoﬀs.
The ﬁgure illustrates that the constrained consumption choices are quantitatively key in capturing the
expected depth in the slump of spending, which is already under way; see <a 
href="#Xbaker_Cpandemic">Baker, Farrokhnia, Meyer,
Pagel, and Yannelis</a> (<a

href="#XnyFedCoronaBlog">Armantier, Kosar, Pomerantz, Skandalis, Smith, Topa, and van
der Klaauw</a> (<a 
href="#XnyFedCoronaBlog">2020</a>) for early evidence. The marginal utility shock hits all households, and
directly aﬀects their spending decisions in the early quarters after the pandemic; its eﬀect
cannot be mitigated by ﬁscal stimulus. The loss of income from unemployment is large,
but aﬀects only a fraction of households, who are disproportionately low income and thus
account for a smaller share of aggregate consumption. Moreover, most households hold at
least some liquid assets, allowing them to smooth their consumption drop — the 5 percent
decrease in labor income in Figure <a 
href="#x1-70012">2<!--tex4ht:ref: labor_income --></a> induces only a 1.5 percent decrease in consumption in

model economy, the extra unemployment beneﬁts amount to $544 per household, while the stimulus

high income households). Aggregated, stimulus checks amount to $267 billion, while the extended

during the peak consumption response in Q3 2020, the stimulus checks account for about
70 percent of the total eﬀect on consumption for the average household and the unemployment
beneﬁts for about 30 percent. Thus, although the unemployment beneﬁts make a much larger
diﬀerence to the spending of the individual recipients than the stimulus checks, a small enough
proportion of households becomes unemployed that the total extra spending coming from these
people is less than the total extra spending from the more widely distributed stimulus

lockdown causes a much longer decline in spending than the shorter lockdown in our primary
scenario. In the shorter pandemic scenario (Figure <a 
href="#x1-80013">3<!--tex4ht:ref: cons_response --></a>) consumption returns to the baseline
path after roughly one year, while in the long lockdown shown here the recovery takes
around three years; that is, the CARES stimulus shortens the consumption drop to about 2
years. The scenario with extended unemployment beneﬁts ensures that aggregate spending
returns to the baseline path after roughly one year, and does so by targeting the funds to
the people who are worst hurt by the crisis and to whom the cash will make the most
diﬀerence.
  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">IV </span> <a 
 id="x1-11000IV"></a>Conclusions</h3>
<!--l. 419--><p class="noindent" >Our model suggests that there may be a strong consumption recovery when the social-distancing
requirements of the pandemic begin to subside. We invite readers to test the robustness of this
conclusion by using the associated software toolkit to choose their own preferred assumptions on the
path of the pandemic, and of unemployment, to understand better how consumption will
respond.
<!--l. 422--><p class="indent" >  One important limitation of our analysis is that it does not incorporate Keynesian demand eﬀects or
other general equilibrium responses to the consumption ﬂuctuations we predict. In practice, Keynesian
eﬀects are likely to cause movements in aggregate income in the same direction as consumption; in
that sense, our estimates can be thought of as a “ﬁrst round” analysis of the dynamics of the
crisis, which will be ampliﬁed by any Keynesian response. (See <a 
href="#Xbayer_corona">Bayer, Born, Luetticke, and
Müller</a> (<a 
href="#Xbayer_corona">2020</a>) for estimates of the multiplier for transfer payments). These considerations
further strengthen the case that the CARES Act will make a substantial diﬀerence to the
economic outcome. A particularly important consideration is that forward-looking ﬁrms that
expect consumer demand to return forcefully in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 are
more likely to maintain relations with their employees so that they can restart production
quickly.
<!--l. 427--><p class="indent" >  The ability to incorporate Keynesian demand eﬀects is one of the most impressive achievements of
the generation of heterogeneous agent macroeconomic models that have been constructed in the last
few years. But the technical challenges of constructing those models are such that they cannot yet
incorporate realistic treatments of features that our model says are quantitatively important,
particularly diﬀering risks of (and types of) unemployment, for diﬀerent kinds of people (young, old;
rich, poor; high- and low-education). This rich heterogeneity is important both to the overall response
to the CARES act, and to making judgments about the extent to which it has been successfully
targeted to provide beneﬁts to those who need them most. A fuller analysis that incorporates
both such heterogeneity, which is of intrinsic interest to policymakers, and a satisfying
treatment of general equilibrium will have to wait for another day, but that day is likely not far
oﬀ.

<!--l. 224--><p class="noindent" >Households are modeled as individuals and incomes sized accordingly. We completely abstract from
family dynamics. To get our aggregate predictions for income and consumption, we take the mean
from our simulation and multiply by 253 million, the number of adults (over 18) in the United States
in 2019. To size the unemployment beneﬁts correctly, we multiply the beneﬁts per worker by 0.8 to
account for the fact that 20 percent of the working-age population is out of the labor force, so the
average working-age household consists of 0.8 workers and 0.2 non-workers. With this adjustment,
there are 151 million workers eligible for unemployment beneﬁts in the model. Aggregate consumption
in our baseline for 2020 is just over $11 trillion, a little less than total personal consumption
expenditure, accounting for the fact that some consumption does not ﬁt in the usual budget
constraint.<sup class="textsuperscript"><a 
href="#enz.19"><span 
class="ec-lmr-10x-x-109">19</span></a></sup> Aggregating in this way underweights the young, as our model excludes those under the
age of 24.
<!--l. 232--><p class="indent" >  Our model estimates the aggregate size of the stimulus checks to be $267 billion, matching the the
Joint Committee on Taxation’s estimate of disbursements in 2020.<sup class="textsuperscript"><a 
href="#enz.20"><span 
class="ec-lmr-10x-x-109">20</span></a></sup> This is somewhat of a
coincidence: we overestimate the number of adults who will actually receive the stimulus, while
excluding the $500 payment to children.
<!--l. 235--><p class="indent" >  The aggregate cost of the extra unemployment beneﬁts depends on the expected level of
unemployment. Our estimate is $137 billion, much less than the $260 billion mentioned in several
press reports, but in line with the extent of unemployment in our pandemic scenario. We
do not account for the extension of unemployment beneﬁts to the self-employed and gig
workers.
<!--l. 239--><p class="indent" >  Households enter the model at age <img 
src="ConsumptionResponse96x.svg" alt="j = 0  " class="math";align="absmiddle"> with zero liquid assets. A ‘newborn’ household has its
initial permanent income drawn lognormally with underlying standard deviation of 0.4 and an
education-conditional mean. The initial employment state of households matches the steady state
unemployment rate of 5%.<sup class="textsuperscript"><a 
href="#enz.21"><span 
class="ec-lmr-10x-x-109">21</span></a></sup>
<!--l. 243--><p class="indent" >  We assume annual population growth of 1%, so older simulated households are appropriately
down-weighted when we aggregate idiosyncratic values. Likewise, each successive cohort is
slightly more productive than the last, with aggregate productivity growing at a rate of 1%
per year. The proﬁle of average income by age in the population at any moment in time
thus has more of an inverted-U shape than implied by the permanent income proﬁles from

<!--l. 248--><p class="noindent" >We model the ‘lockdown’ as a reduction in the marginal utility of consumption. This can be
interpreted as an increase in the quality-adjusted price of goods, where the quality of basic goods such
as shelter and housing has not decreased, but more discretionary goods such as vacations and
restaurants have decreased in quality.
<!--l. 251--><p class="indent" >  Figure <a 
href="#x1-1600111">11<!--tex4ht:ref: concave_cons --></a> shows how this works. In normal times, the cost of a consumption unit is equal to one,
represented by the blue line. During the lockdown, the cost of a unit of consumption is
                                                                                             
                                                                                             
increasing in the number of units bought. As shown here, the number of consumption units
that can be bought follows the lower envelope of the blue and orange lines, where the
orange line is equal to <img 
src="ConsumptionResponse97x.svg" alt="Costα  " class="math";align="absmiddle">. As long as the household is consuming above the kink,
their utility is <img 
src="ConsumptionResponse98x.svg" alt="        α
log(Cost ) = α log(Cost)  " class="math";align="absmiddle">, exactly equivalent to the reduction in marginal
utility we apply. Taking this interpretation seriously, the drop in marginal utility should
not be applied to households with very low levels of consumption, below the kink. Our
implementation abstracts from this, taking the marginal utility factor to be the same for all agents.
