  volume =        {2},
  year =          {2016},
  abstract =      {The goal of this chapter is to study how, and by how
                   much, household income, wealth, and preference
                   heterogeneity amplify and propagate a macroeconomic
                   shock. We focus on the U.S. Great Recession of
                   2007-2009 and proceed in two steps. First, using data
                   from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we document
                   the patterns of household income, consumption and
                   wealth inequality before and during the Great
                   Recession. We then investigate how households in
                   different segments of the wealth distribution were
                   affected by income declines, and how they changed
                   their expenditures differentially during the
                   aggregate downturn. Motivated by this evidence, we
                   study several variants of a standard heterogeneous
                   household model with aggregate shocks and an
                   endogenous cross-sectional wealth distribution. Our
                   key finding is that wealth inequality can
                   significantly amplify the impact of an aggregate
                   shock, and it does so if the distribution features a
                   sufficiently large fraction of households with very
                   little net worth that sharply increase their saving
                   (i.e. they are not hand-to mouth) as the recession
                   hits. We document that both these features are
                   observed in the PSID. We also investigate the role
                   that social insurance policies, such as unemployment
                   insurance, play in shaping the cross-sectional income
                   and wealth distribution, and through it, the dynamics
                   of business cycles.},

                   “habits” to explain the substantial persistence
                   of aggregate consumption growth. But a large
                   literature has found no evidence of habits in
                   microeconomic datasets that measure the behavior of
                   individual households. We show that the apparent
                   conflict can be explained by a model in which
                   consumers have accurate knowledge of their personal
                   circumstances but ‘sticky expectations’ about the
                   macroeconomy. In our model, the persistence of
                   aggregate consumption growth reflects consumers’
                   imperfect attention to aggregate shocks. Our proposed
                   degree of (macro) inattention has negligible utility
                   costs, because aggregate shocks constitute only a
                   tiny proportion of the uncertainty that consumers
                   face.},
